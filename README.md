# GNN Topology Representation Learning for Deformable Multi-Linear Objects Dual-Arm Robotic Manipulation

Abstract:
Deformable Multi-Linear Objects (DMLOs), or Branched Deformable Linear Objects (BDLOs), are flexible objects that possess a linear structure similar to DLOs but also feature branching or bifurcation points where the objectâ€™s path diverges into multiple sections. The representation of complex DMLOs, such as wiring harnesses, poses significant challenges in various applications, including robotic systemsâ€™ perception and manipulation planning. This paper proposes an approach to address the robust and efficient estimation of a topological representation for DMLOs leveraging a graph-based description of the scene obtained via graph neural networks. Starting from a binary mask of the scene, graph nodes are sampled along the objectsâ€™ estimated centerlines. Then, a data-driven pipeline is employed to learn the assignment of graph edges between nodes and to characterize the nodeâ€™s type based on their local topology and orientation. Finally, by utilizing the learned information, a solver combines the predictions and generates a coherent representation of the objects in the scene. The approach is experimentally evaluated using a test set of complex real-world DMLOs. Within an offline evaluation, the proposed approach achieves a Dice score exceeding 90% in predicting graph edges. Similarly, the identification accuracy of branch and intersection points in the graph topology is above 90%. Additionally, the method demonstrates efficient performance, achieving a runtime of over 20 FPS. In an online assessment employing a dual-arm robotic setup, the approach is successfully applied to disentangle three automotive wiring harnesses, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a real-world scenario.
